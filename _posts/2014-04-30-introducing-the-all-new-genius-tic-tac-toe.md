[Genius Tic-Tac-Toe](https://geniustictactoe.com/) is a strategy game. It takes regular Tic-Tac-Toe to a whole new level by adding new, complex rules. In Genius Tic-Tac-Toe, you play both the game, _and your opponent_.

The game builds off of another game called [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/).

You can play it online or with a friend on one device. Since this is an **online two-player game**, you need to [create an account](https://geniustictactoe.com/register/) to get started!

Your games will instantly update whenever you or your opponent makes a move. That way you can play in one sitting or over a few days.

Afraid of missing the action? You will get notifications in your notifications panel whenever anything happens while you're away.
