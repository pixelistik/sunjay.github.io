I started taking public transit regularly almost 4 years ago. It was back when I started taking it to school in September of grade 10. That was my first year of high school (known commonly as senior high and other variations in other parts of the world).<!--more-->

Taking public transit for me was at first a very freeing experience. It was nice having the freedom and ability to go almost anywhere in the city without having to rely on my parents.

It was also quite difficult to begin with. On my first day riding alone, I tried to be clever and ended up in downtown Calgary with no idea where to go. I somehow managed to find my mother's work building and she helped me get home.

My ride to school took me about 45 minutes each day. I would take a bus to get to the Somerset-Bridlewood train station. Then I would take the train for about 15 minutes and end up at Heritage station. The bus ride from there was only about 5-10 minutes long, but usually I'd end up waiting for a few minutes at Heritage. That bus dropped me almost right in front of my school.

A lot has changed in these last few years. Including me. I've grown and transformed quite a bit. I've gone from taking transit on my own to living on my own and have even almost gotten to the point where I can save up and support myself. That's a shift I'm very proud of and it is something I will continue to develop.

Here's to the future!

##### On walking&#8230;

I took that route each day, twice a day, for three years. Back and forth. You can see how mundane and repetitive that would get after a while.

Personally, I much prefer to walk places. I really like walking. I've been lucky enough to live by lots of parks my entire life and walking in those has always been a delight. Walking around in the sun or in the rain, the smell of nature or even just the passing of time.

When you're living a filled up life with a million things to do all the time, walking around and doing nothing productive for a few hours is actually a lot of fun!
