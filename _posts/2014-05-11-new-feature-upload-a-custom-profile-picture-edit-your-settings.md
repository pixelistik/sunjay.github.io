Due to popular demand, you can now upload your own custom profile picture for use in <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a>.

If you prefer your Gravatar, you can continue to use that as well.

If you would rather have no picture at all, there's an option for that too!

&nbsp;

To edit your picture, please visit **<a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/u/" target="_blank">your profile</a>**.

You can now also alter basic settings in Genius Tic-Tac-Toe as well. As the game gets more complex, the settings page will be your go-to location to find out how to configure things so they work best for YOU.

You can access your settings by clicking on the dropdown menu button by your name or picture in the top right corner of the page. Select "<a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/settings/" target="_blank">Settings</a>" from that dropdown and you will be taken to your settings page.

You can also view your settings by clicking on this link: **<a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/settings/" target="_blank">Your Settings Page</a>** (you may need to login first)

There are lots of new features on the way! Create an account on Genius Tic-Tac-Toe and start playing now!

You can challenge me to a game by creating a game with the user "admin".
