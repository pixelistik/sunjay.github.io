ANYONE, and I mean ANYONE can learn HTML and make a web page. In fact, most anyone nowadays can make a full blown website as well. Thanks to technologies like WordPress, Tumblr, and other WYSIWYG editors of all kinds, all it takes is some money, the right software, and time.

Making a GOOD website however, is far more arduous. It's not as simple as organizing your HTML, CSS and JavaScript into some neat little files and uploading it all to the web.

A "smart" web developer puts in a lot more thought than that.

For a "smart" web developer, there's a certain _elegance_ and a certain _grace_ in writing things for the web. There's no limit to what you can create on the web these days. With the release of all kinds of new technologies and APIs in HTML5, web developers can do whatever they want.

The "smart" developers aren't even limited by their browsers. Browsers can be [great](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and also in other cases [terrible](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=1). If you're really "smart" though, it doesn't matter.

There's a brilliant little technique that takes advantage of the very important and often ill-considered concept of **fallbacks**.

A fallback is exactly what it sounds like, its a "backup plan" for you to use if your application fails for any reason at all. A fallback is a graceful way to provide the user with an "OK" experience even when they aren't capable of using your application to the fullest.

Designing these fallbacks is what separates an "okay" web developer from a "smart" web developer.

When you're a smart web developer, you're thinking about ALL kinds of users. You're trying to design your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a way where you can satisfy as many people as possible. Yes it's true that it's a fool's game to try and satisfy everyone, but you can get pretty close as long as you're always thinking. (After all, if someone is still using IE6 after all these years, they probably deserve to suffer at least a little bit)

It's never just about the power users using capable browsers or just about the end users who maybe don't know enough to use something different. It can even be about making your pages available for people who require even more accessibility; people who use things like magnifiers or screen readers. Mobile devices also encompass a whole new realm of thought.

Responsive design (something I'll go into more detail about in later posts), is all about this.

The "smart" web developers are looking out for everyone, making sure they can reach the biggest audiences possible. Next time you're looking at designing even the simplest web pages, make sure you're really considering everyone, not just the most or least capable of your users.

It's always possible to do more to make things even better than they are.
