## I LOVE to learn new and interesting things.

Programming is my passion and it has been for over 5 years. I often get asked just about the things I know about or have explored. Here is my attempt at creating a working list of just _some_ of the things I have either picked up or mastered. It's by no means a complete list. Afterall, I learn new things everyday and forget older concepts as well. Use this page to get a glimpse at what I can do. This is by no means an exhaustive list.<!--more-->

### Programming Languages:

The phrase "Programming Language" actually suffers from quite a bit of ambiguity. For the purposes of this blog post, let's just say that a programming language is any language that is used on computers either in software or on the web (also software). (Listed in order of expertise, 1 = mastery)

  1. Python
  2. JavaScript
  3. (X)HTML (4+, including the new tags in 5)
  4. CSS (2+)
  5. C
  6. Java
  7. C#
  8. PHP
  9. XML
 10. SQL

### Frameworks, Libraries, Protocols, Specific Language Features:

These are in no particular order. This list just represents some topics that relate to specific languages. I'm creating this list because knowledge of a specific language does not necessarily mean that I have knowledge of the specific features of that language. This is my attempt to clarify and be more specific about some of the things you can expect me to know about. Python

  * Django
  * PyGame

Client-Side Web

  * AJAX
  * JSON
  * jQuery
  * Twitter Bootstrap
  * Ember JS
  * WebSockets
  * WordPress (theme creation from scratch)

### Topics, Concepts, Softwares, Other Information

Anyone can walk into a room and say they know how to program in Python. Python is a fantastic language that is both easy to learn and extremely extensible. This list is my way of being more specific about all the different worlds of programming that I have explored. Diversity is the very nature of integrated programming and large scale development. You don't do something big in one thing without also learning about all of the little parts (languages, frameworks, features, etc.) that come with it.

#### Topics/Concepts:

  * Responsive Design
  * Text processing
  * Databases (SQLite, MySQL, etc.)
  * Client/server communication and application development
  * Basic socket communication
  * File handling and file system programming including some basic compression and pickling
  * Multitasking (multithreading/multiprocessing)
  * FTP, POP, SMTP, HTTP, etc.
  * Complex GUI development
  * CGI development with Python on the web (Django is a more efficient and robust way to do this)
  * Algorithms (basic searching and sorting, knowledge of algorithm complexity)
  * Security &#8211; validation, secure storage of information in databases, password cracking and cryptography, preventing attacks
  * Closures and context sensitive programming

#### Softwares:

  * Git
  * Mercurial
  * Cygwin (commands, SSH, etc.)
  * PyCharm
  * Eclipse
  * Photoshop
  * Illustrator
  * LabVIEW
  * Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.
