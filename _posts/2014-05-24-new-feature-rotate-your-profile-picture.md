You can now **rotate your profile picture** in Genius Tic-Tac-Toe.

As well as that, photo uploads are now much smarter. **Uploading files from your phone will now take into account the orientation of your phone** when the picture was taken. No more sideways photos that should be right side up!

**To rotate your picture, upload a picture using the "Edit Picture" dialog on your profile page. Then use the rotation buttons on the uploaded picture to change its rotation. Hit "Save" when you're done to keep your changes.**

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you have a previously uploaded photo and your rotation does not work once you hit "Save", please re-upload your photo. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You should only have to do this once.</span> It will work for you after that.</strong></span>

Please note that rotation is only supported for photos you upload, not for your gravatar or for the default photo. **Rotation is also disabled on phones**, so please use your computer or a larger device (like a tablet).
