My name is Sunjay Varma. I am a highly experienced software developer and future computer engineer currently studying at the University of Waterloo. 

What sets me apart from other software developers is my high degree of experience in web development, ability to quickly pick up on *any* new technology and the little details I see that other developers may not.

Above all, I seek out opportunities to do incredible work. I build awesome software because I love software and really enjoy writing it well. Being detail oriented is great, but as a mature software developer I take it to the next level by knowing which details I can skip and still deliver a fantastic result.

I know I can pick up any technology very quickly because I do it all the time. I learn new programming languages all the time, pick up new frameworks on the go at work, and continue building my skills all the time.

I have been writing software for over 7 years. It's my favorite thing to do because you can build anything with software. From small interfaces to entire universes, I can make it all.

Let's build something amazing.
