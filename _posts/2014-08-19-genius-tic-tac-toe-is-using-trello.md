A few months ago I started a new project with a friend and needed some way to manage our project that made sense for our small team. I found <a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a> on <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit</a> and everything about it just fit. It's a free, easy to use and completely cross-platform application. I have even started using it for managing <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a>.

Usually, when I'm working by myself, I organize my ideas using lists. LOTS of lists: lists of ideas, bugs, important decisions. I have traditionally used fairly archaic tools like pens and paper to design different components and what they should do.

<a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a> allows me to think in lists and also bring those lists online in a way that's very easy to use and understand. Adding items to lists is a first-class operation in <a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a>. It's easy, fast and very intuitive. It's always easy to see the big picture since all of my lists are displayed right beside each other in full. No more switching between lists one at a time.

Managing a project with a friend (or a larger team) is beyond easy too. One of us adds a card, assigns the other person to it and then starts a discussion in that card's comments. We can organize everything into different lists and move things around quickly and intuitively.

**One of the best features:** <a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a> is cross-platform and completely responsive. I can use it on my phone, tablet and computer. As soon as I have an idea I can pull out my phone and quickly put it into the correct list. Everything is immediately updated on all of my devices without me doing a thing.

<a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a> fits <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a> perfectly. I have wanted this kind of application for a very long time. I was even trying to use <a href="https://keep.google.com/keep/" target="_blank">Google Keep</a> for these purposes, but it's not nearly as good. Today I finished moving all of my old todo and bugs lists into <a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a>. It was a seamless experience and I was able to expand on many of my list items in a way I never could with Google Keep or a piece of paper and a pen.

If you're looking to manage a project, business, or just your life, I highly recommend using <a href="https://trello.com/sunjayvarma/recommend" target="_blank">Trello</a>. It's made a big difference.
