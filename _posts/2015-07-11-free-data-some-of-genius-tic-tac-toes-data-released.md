I collect LOTS of data in [Genius Tic-Tac-Toe](https://geniustictactoe.com/).

Nothing privacy related of course&#8230; _Hides from NSA__&#8230;_

I collect information about the games people create, the moves they make, who wins, loses, offers a tie or resigns. This information is very important to not only the basic functionality of the game, but also for me when I'm writing cool new features like artificial intelligence, move suggestions and also play-by-play game review.

**Today I've decided to release some of that data publicly.** 

This data set is pretty cool. It features 172 finished games of the 209 games currently created games of Genius Tic-Tac-Toe. In the data set, you'll find the complete picture of each game: the moves that were made, what the board looked like every move and who won and who lost.

There's no personal information in any of the data I'm releasing so feel free to use it however you like.

A quick chart I spun up from the dataset:
