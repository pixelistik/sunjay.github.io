When I show people [Genius Tic-Tac-Toe](https://geniustictactoe.com/), the first question I usually get is

> "How long did it take you to make this?"

That's actually a really hard question to answer. <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a> is actually based on a similar (but subtly different) game called [Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/). I first read about it around June 22, 2013 in a [Math With Bad Drawings post](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/) thanks to my good friend <a href="https://github.com/neilparikh" target="_blank">Neil Parikh</a>.

It was such an interesting game, I just couldn't help making it! My programming brain was going crazy figuring out the data structures and class structure I would use to make it powerful, flexible and extensible. I love writing "pretty" code. It's just who I am.

So you could say I've been working on it for over a year since I first started writing it way back in June of last year.

That summer, I was working 3 jobs. As a programmer working remotely for a startup in Toronto, bike camp instructor at Pedalheads and assistant at a Kumon Math & Reading Centre, I really didn't have much of a chance to work on (what was then still called) Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. That means, that while I did start it way back in June, I didn't actually work on it very actively back then.

I put the project under version control on August 5, 2013. That was the date of my first commit. Here's an extremely wide version of my commit frequencies. (Click the image to see a larger version.)

The dates are on the x-axis and on the y-axis you can see how many commits I made on that date.

As you can see, there are a lot of really long periods where I just didn't commit, or where I just made one commit. In fact, by the time I got to that area of in March with a whole lot of commits, I had completely forgotten most of my code! I had to refresh my memory and figure out what I was trying to do!

Around April was the time I really got serious about the project. You could actually say that most of <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a>&#8216;s features and code came out of about a three month period (March to May) where it was basically all I thought about.

My record for most commits in one day for this project is 23 commits on May 5, 2014. The next closest day was April 30, 2014 (the day before release) with 18 commits.

Commits don't necessarily mean that I was only working on <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a> on the day of that commit, but they do give a pretty good indication of how frequently I was working on the project as a whole.

Looking at my commit history, it seems that although I first started writing code for <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a> in June of 2013, I have really only spent a total of around 3 months working on it. That's a pretty significant amount of time, and although I'm very biased, I think it's turned out pretty great.
