**Coding will teach you a way to think that will help you make your life so much easier.**

Anyone who can think and apply any amount of basic logic can learn how to code. It is really that simple. Sure there are advanced topics and yes it will take practice just like anything else if you want to get it just right, but the payoff is just amazing.

Many claim that the main reason you should learn how to code is because we live in a technology filled world and therefore it is probably useful to know a bit about how things work and how you can make them work. This is quite true, however it's really not a very strong argument for people _everywhere_ to just start learning how to program. After all, not everyone lives every moment of their lives in a computer dominated environment. Even if they do, they aren't required to know everything about what they are using in order to use it.

Sure we live in a technology filled world, but as that world develops one could argue that it is becoming easier and easier to _not_ have to learn about what we use at all. After all, since the wide variety of users are "end users" (users who generally don't know how to program and often don't know how to use much of their computers at all), most software is developed to be very straightforward.

You do not need to know the inner workings of any of the apps on my phone in order to use them properly.

**So why learn programming at all then?**

When you program, you learn a very complex and very important set of reasoning. You learn how to take a problem and compute its answer using (often) very simple rules that when put together form a more complex solution. This sort of skill helps you in the real world by allowing you to quickly develop solutions to your own day-to-day challenges by putting together the simple things you know already. Programming teaches you a way to think and also allows you to automate a lot of what's going on in your life.

This is really cool because it allows you to take really anything in your life and do it faster using a computer. If time is money, computers are saving the world billions and billions of dollars every day. As an individual, you can take any repetitive task and write a program that does it all for you. What could be easier?

Just by reading this article you are using a piece of software that someone created in order to "optimize" or automate a very complex and repetitive task. Attempting to access the interest without a computer or even without a proper piece of software is very tedious and almost impossible without a very deep understanding of how everything works. Your interest browser is doing all kinds of things behind the scene so that you can just get on with your day.

Imagine something you do a lot in your life. This can just be something you do frequently, or even better something frequent that you do not enjoy doing that much at all. Now imagine if there was some way for you to never have to worry about doing that again!

**Coding gives you an access to a whole new _realm_ of creation.** Learning

about both hardware and software gives you even more than that. You can make pretty much anything you can imagine.

That is a lot of power. Don't hold yourself back from getting it.

Even if you're thinking about learning code but don't think you're cut out for it or think won't understand what you're doing, I recommend trying to learn it anyway.

There's a language out there called [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python). Python is easy to learn for everyone to learn and it will allow you to do really anything that you desire. It's a nice clean language that is used by big companies such as Google and it is extremely powerful and sophisticated. It's honestly just one of the best languages in the world. Maybe I'll write a whole post on just why Python is great.

For now though, JUST START CODING. Try it out and do some simple examples. You'll find that once you start, it will become very easy to create and automate what you want.
