This is the source code for my personal website.

If you find an issue with a page on my website or one of my posts, please
open a [new GitHub issue][issues].

This currently static website is hosted on GitHub Pages. This is convenient because all of my projects automatically get their own directories on my
domain name. For example, the `snake` project `gh-pages` branch can be seen
at `http://sunjay.ca/snake`.

## TODO

- [ ] Projects page
- [ ] Thumbnails of all projects linking to the projects page
