<a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/" target="_blank">Genius Tic-Tac-Toe</a> has been going through some major improvements!

Here's a quick summary of what you can expect to see in the latest update:

  * **New Streamlined Registration** &#8211; Registration is now fast and easy. No more need to fill out endlessly long forms!
  * **Enhanced Sidebar/Games Menu** &#8211; The games menu is now more useful than ever! Use the "Games" button on every screen to access it. See below for more about what's new!
  * **Tie-Offers & Game Results Look Better Than Ever** &#8211; These game overlays have been rewritten and enhanced to be more visually appealing!
  * **Game Requests So You Can Play More Easily With Friends** &#8211; Games with friends are automatically accepted so you can start playing right away. Games from everyone else need to be accepted by you before they can start. You can adjust this in <a href="https://geniustictactoe.com/settings/" target="_blank">your settings</a>.

## Enhanced Games Menu

The benefits you get from this update:

  * **New Cleaner Design** &#8211; The new design allows you to see more than just a few games at a time! It is also smarter when it comes to scrolling and loading! Everything has been visually crafted to give  you more information with less!
  * **Easily See Finished Games** &#8211; No more scrolling all the way past your current games! You can see your finished games with just a few taps! This update adds a simple dropdown menu that allows you to quickly select between your current and previously completed games!
  * **Faster load times** &#8211; The menu now loads faster and only when you click on it. That means smaller pages which load faster both on your PC and on your phone!
  * **Focus For Your Games** &#8211; If there's too much happening on a page at once, it's hard to focus on what's important: beating your opponent! This new design moves the sidebar away and still allows you to open it when you need it!
  * **Stays Up To Date With Your Current Game** &#8211; The sidebar will now refresh when your game does! You no longer need to refresh the page to update it. If you want to refresh it manually, you can use the new dropdown menu and select the current item.

## Tie Offers & Game Results &#8211; New Design

This new update makes these components visually consistent with the rest of the design, makes them even more responsive for all of your devices and makes it easier to see all the information you need to keep playing!

## NEW: Game Requests

Game requests are meant to make it easier for you to play with your friends while also protecting you from people you don't want to play. Games are no longer automatically started&#8211;friends who make games with you are the only ones who can start playing you right away. (You can adjust this in [your settings](https://geniustictactoe.com/settings/).)

You don't need to do anything special to use game requests. Just create games as you would usually and it will all be handled for you.

<div id="attachment_336" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
